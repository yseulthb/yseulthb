### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc at the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://biology.umbc.edu/) of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), in Baltimore, MD (USA). There I work on sexual signal design in the darter fish ([*Etheosomatidae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheostomatinae)) with [Tamra Mendelson](https://www.mendelsonlab.net/) in collaboration with [Julien Renoult](https://www.eevcom-montpellier.com/julien-renoult.html) in Montpellier, France where I spent the first year of my postdoc. The idea is to use artificial neural networks to create novel stimuli that mimic natural statistics to understand better the evolution of pattern preferences and sexual signal design ([processing bias theory and efficient coding framework](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0165)). Besides this project, I also explore the link between visual attractiveness and camouflage patterns in humans.
