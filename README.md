### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc at the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://biology.umbc.edu/) of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), in Baltimore, MD (USA). 

I work on sexual signal design in the darter fish ([*Etheosomatidae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheostomatinae)) with [Tamra Mendelson](https://www.mendelsonlab.net/) in collaboration with [Julien Renoult](https://www.eevcom-montpellier.com/julien-renoult.html) in Montpellier, France. 
We use artificial neural networks to create novel stimuli that mimic natural statistics [[NST_fish project]](https://github.com/yseulthb/NST_fish) to understand better the evolution of pattern preferences and sexual signal design. <br>
Besides this project, I explore the link between visual attractiveness and camouflage patterns in humans [[camo_exp project]](https://github.com/yseulthb/camo_exp)) and I also have several small research projects with students.
Because some of my collaborators prefer to use Gitlab, I also have repositories on that platform [here](https://gitlab.com/yseulthb). 

I like sharing tips on Open Science and introducing Deep Learning concepts to biologists not familiar with it yet. I also love the Slow Science philosophy that sees academia as part of an ecosystem. You can find more about this on this page: [Slow Science](https://yseulthb.github.io/slowscience/). 

I am always open for collaborations, discussions, soul-searching and/or fun questions, or anything else really. Feel free to [reach out](yseulthb@gmail.com)! 

You can find more information on my [personal wesbite](https://yseulthb.github.io/).
